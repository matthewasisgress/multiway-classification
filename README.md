## R packages

This project uses the R programming language (R Core Team, 2025). In addition, 
this project uses two R packages found on The Comprehensive R Archive Network 
(i.e., CRAN) including: **cpfa** (Asisgress, 2025) and **dslabs** 
(Irizarry and Gill, 2025). Note that the R package **cpfa** depends
upon the R package **mulitway** (Helwig, 2025), which itself depends on the R 
package **CMLS** (Helwig, 2025).

## Data

This application uses the MNIST dataset (LeCun, Cortes, and Burges, 1998; LeCun 
et al., 2002), which is automatically downloaded when the R Markdown file is 
run. Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes hold the copyright of the MNIST dataset, 
which is a derivative work from original NIST datasets. The MNIST dataset is 
made available under the terms of the CC BY-SA 3.0 license, which can be viewed
