# multiway-classification
Application of the R package **cpfa** to three real datasets.

Author: Matthew Asisgress

Package URL: <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cpfa>.

## Overview

We apply R package **cpfa** (Asisgress, 2025) to three real datasets. First, we 
apply the package MNIST (LeCun, Cortes, and Burges, 1998; LeCun et al., 
2002)---showing how the package can be used to distinguish between images of the
digits 2 and 3. Next, we apply the package to Fashion MNIST (Xiao, Rasul, and 
Vollgraf, 2017)---distinguishing among images of tops, trousers, and sandals. 
Finally, we apply the package to VesselMNIST3D (Yang et al., 2020) from the 
MedMNIST database (Yang et al., 2023; Yang, Shi, Ni, 2021). VesselMNIST3D 
contains three-dimensional representations of blood vessels, and we distinguish 
healthy blood vessels from aneurysm blood vessels. For this project, the source 
file `mcrd.Rmd` contains original text and code used to produce the two reports 
`mcrd.pdf` and `mcrd.html`, which both contain results.

## License

This project is dual-licensed. All code and text, including the `mcrd.Rmd` 
source file and the `convert_npz_to_h5.py` file, is licensed under the MIT 
license. See the `LICENSE` file for details. Generated reports (`mcrd.pdf` and 
`mcrd.html`), as derivative works of the MNIST dataset, are licensed under the 
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0) license.

## R packages

This project uses the R programming language (R Core Team, 2025). In addition, 
this project uses five R packages found on The Comprehensive R Archive Network 
(CRAN) including: **cpfa** (Asisgress, 2025), **dslabs** (Irizarry and Gill, 
2025), **keras3** (Kalinowski, Allaire, and Chollet, 2025), **rhdf5** 
(Fischer, Smith, and Pau, 2025), and **plotly** (Sievert, 2020). Note that R 
package **cpfa** depends on R package **mulitway** (Helwig, 2025), which itself 
depends on **CMLS** (Helwig, 2025).

## Data

This project uses three datasets. First, it uses MNIST (LeCun, Cortes, and 
Burges, 1998; LeCun et al., 2002). Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes hold the 
copyright of the MNIST dataset, which is a derivative work from the original 
NIST datasets. MNIST is made available under the terms of the CC BY-SA 3.0 
license, which can be viewed here: 
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en>. Moreover, this project 
uses Fashion MNIST (Xiao, Rasul, and Vollgraf, 2017). Zalando SE holds the 
copyright for Fashion MNIST, and the associated MIT license for this dataset can 
be found at the end of this README. Finally, this project uses VesselMNIST3D 
(Yang et al., 2020) from the MedMNIST database (Yang et al., 2023; Yang, Shi, 
Ni, 2021). VesselMNIST3D is made available under the terms of the Creative 
Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, which can be viewed 
here: <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en>. 

MNIST and Fashion MNIST are downloaded when `mcrd.Rmd` runs. VesselMNIST3D is 
provided in the project GitHub repository in both its original .npz file format 
and an .h5 file format. The Python script 'convert_npz_to_h5.py' was used to 
convert VesselMNIST3D from .npz to .h5. This script is made available in the 
project repository. When `mcrd.Rmd` runs, it subsets a given dataset, builds a 
classification rule between data and class labels, and provides summaries of 
these analyses. Results can be viewed within output files `mcrd.pdf` or 
`mcrd.html`.
